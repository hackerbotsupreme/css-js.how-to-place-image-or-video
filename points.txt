first , 
thing (and it is th imoortant thing also )
that each element is having the 
total viewport 
which means 100vh ,
and how can we do that ?

make the div ,
  min-height: 100vh;

  ////////////////////////

but the next thing is how 
each of them  have a line 

whie display flex make element side by side 
and to make them up and down
we have two options ,
1. flex-direction  : column 
2. flex-wrap : wrap 

so any of it  works .

  ////////////////////////

but that is not the most crazy part 
the most crazy part it ,
to fit photo and video we only used ,


/* img  */
.container .box img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  mix-blend-mode: screen;
}
/* video */
.container .box video {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}

but what does this do?
  mix-blend-mode: screen;

The CSS property mix-blend-mode with the value screen is used to control how the colors of overlapping elements or layers in a web page are blended together when they intersect. Specifically, the "screen" blending mode lightens the colors, creating a brightening effect.

Critical Points:

The "screen" blending mode in CSS takes the colors of the top layer and blends them with the colors of the underlying layers, resulting in a lighter and often more vibrant appearance.
It works by inverting the colors of the top layer and then multiplying them with the colors of the layers below. This effectively lightens the dark areas of the top layer.
The "screen" mode is particularly useful for creating highlights, glow effects, or for adding light to an image or design element.

  ////////////////////////

but the next question that arises is how 
if the video is seen without the  mix-blend why do the picture need it ?
